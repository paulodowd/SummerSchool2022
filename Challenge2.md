# Challenge 2: Circumnavigation

For this exercise, you should program a robot controller so that your simulated robot follows the perimeter of an obstruction:

## Help

In this exercise, it will be easier if you decide beforehand that your robot should always rotate in one direction. The task then becomes a behaviour pattern to keep an obstruction within the side sensor of the robot.  If the side sensor measures too close, the robot should turn away slightly.  If the side sensor is measuring too far, the robot should turn towards the obstruction slightly.
