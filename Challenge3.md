An interesting challenge in this task is to be able to write 1 functional controller that will be copied on to many robots.  When you edit the `Controller_c.js` file `update()` function - this same function will be applied to all robots.

## Getting Started

To get started on this exercise, it is recommended you work with just the two front sensors (`0` and `3` - unless you have modified the sensor positions).
